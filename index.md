##RoyalScript

RoyalScript is a functional programming language with modern features and syntax. Sick of scheme lists? RoyalScript has pythonic lists and function calls. 

What can you do with RoyalScript?

* Create mutable structs
* Append, pop, push and more with lists
* Use for loops and while loops
* Use ranges like those from Python
* List comprehensions with `map` and `filter`
* Call functions from javascript
* Run it right on the browser
* Still use recursion!


Take a look at the guide, or try the in browser REPL, or the playground.
