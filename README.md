#RoyalScript

##Intro

RoyalScript is a functional programming languag that aims to combine the utility of popular functional programming languages with the mutable data structures found in object oriented languages. The language is also quickly compiled to compressed JavaScript, so it can be run in the browser, without having to download anything on your computer. Lastly, RoyalScript is also inter-operable with javascript functions. You can call native javascript functions from RoyalScirpt as well!

##Computational Functions

The major difference between RoyalScript and other functional languags lik Scheme is that RoyalScript functions do not *always* evaluate to some resulting value.
